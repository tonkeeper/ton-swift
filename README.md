# TON Swift

Pure Swift implementation of TON core data structures: integers, bitstrings, cells, bags of cells, contracts and messages.

The focus of the library is type safety and serialization. It does not support connectivity to TON p2p network, or Toncenter, Tonapi.io etc.

# Example
To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

# Installation
Ready for use on iOS 13+.

### CocoaPods:
[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'TonSwift', '1.0.2'
```

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler. It is in early development, but TonSwift does support its use on supported platforms. 

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding TonSwift as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/tonkeeper/ton-swift", .exact("1.0.2"))
]
```
